# Salivary miRNA signatures as non-invasive biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma

## Rotroff Lab

The objective of the project is exploration of miRNA in saliva as biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma. The data files required for the scripts are available as supplemental material in the paper, *Salivary miRNA signatures as non-invasive biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma: a pilot study*. These data files can be used with the two listed scripts: master_functions.R and master_scripts_git.R.
